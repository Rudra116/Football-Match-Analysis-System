# Football Analysis Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in a video using **YOLO**, one of the best AI object detection models available.  
We will also train the model to improve its performance.

Additionally, I assigned players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using **Kmeans** for pixel segmentation and clustering. With this information, we can measure a team's ball acquisition percentage in a match.

I also used **optical flow** to measure camera movement between frames, enabling myself to accurately measure a player's movement. Furthermore, I implemented **perspective transformation** to represent the scene's depth and perspective, allowing measure of player's movement in meters rather than pixels.

Finally, I calculated a player's **speed** and the **distance covered**.
